<p>There are two meanings of cloud computing. It is commonly referred to as run workload remotely in the data center of a commercial provider over the internet. Cloud computing is also described based on how it works. It is a virtual pool of resources from computer to application functionalities available on demand. When the customer acquires cloud services, a provider fulfills there requests with advanced automation techniques than manual provisioning. The main advantage of this is agility. It means an ability to apply storage, abstracted compute and network resourcing to workload as required and tap into plenty of prebuilt services.</p>
<p>In simple terms, cloud computing allows need-based or on-demand access to computing services like databases, servers, software, networking, analytics, storage, and application over the internet. There are several benefits of cloud computing like cost-saving, improved productivity, speedy delivery, scalability, performance reliability, and flexibility.</p>
<p>There is a high demand for <a href="https://www.compufytechnolab.com/"><strong>Cloud strategy consulting</strong> services</a>.

<p>Cloud Strategy is a subset of IT or Information Strategy. It is a part of and supports a business strategy. This is a formal definition that shows how resources are allocated to cloud computing. In such a way that cloud computing is arranged to deliver discriminated value to the customers&#8217; business.</p>
<p>There are many factors behind the improved interest in Cloud strategy. It ranges from starting failure using the cloud to achieve great success. The following cloud strategy descriptions are applied to each organization:</p>
<ul>
<li>With better cloud computing planning, good cloud computing implementation works out</li>
<li>The organization who already began cloud adoption, but for greater success, they want to go back for completing cloud panning steps properly.</li>
<li>An organization that struggles with their initial cloud computing and want to develop a new strategy to reset plans and overcome prior setbacks.</li>
<li>The organization that achieved success through cloud strategy and want to refresh or renew its strategy for expanding or building on initial success.</li>
<li>Urgently an organization requires cloud strategy because of the consequences facing wrong cloud computing. Cloud strategy is very important here.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the cloud strategy patterns that reflect how an organization, in general, adopts this technology, how conservative or aggressive it is adopting new technology, and how much maturity level its strategies are planning and executed.</p>

			<h3><strong>Cloud Migration</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-28538" src="../../www.compufytechnolab.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Cloud-Migration.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="350" srcset="https://www.compufytechnolab.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Cloud-Migration.jpg 750w, https://www.compufytechnolab.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Cloud-Migration-300x140.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<div class="clr"></div>
<p>Cloud Migration was a process when organizations&#8217; applications, data, and other business materials moved from computers to the cloud. Cloud is the virtual pool on-demand that shares resources and offers storage and network services at a big scale. This is a bug process involved in cloud computing. A <a href="https://techreviewer.co/top-cloud-consulting-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cloud consulting firm</a> offers you this service in the best possible manner. The steps included are:-</p>
<h4><strong>1) Planning and Preparation</strong></h4>
<p>Before starting the actual migration, preparation is required. The details of preparation depend on the business. Still, there are some basic steps to be followed. First of all, you must ask yourself why you want to move to the cloud. There are many benefits but what your organization is going to benefits from must be clear.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud migration services</strong> oversee the migration process perfectly. In a large migration, the organization must make technical decisions and plans. Therefore you need a specialist that is needed for the success of your project.</p>
<p>There are two ways to migrate your application; shallow cloud integration and deep cloud integration. When you move the on-premises application to the cloud without making or limited changes on the cloud server for running, the application is called shallow cloud integration. A simple application changes are enough for it to run in a new environment.</p>
<p>While modifying the application to take the full benefits of cloud capabilities is called deep cloud integration. It is simple to use, like auto-scaling or dynamic load balancing. It might be sophisticated to utilize computing capabilities without the server for the application.</p>
<h4><strong>2) Choosing the Cloud Environment</strong></h4>
<p>Before starting cloud migration, decide what type of cloud model you will adopt? Choose between a single cloud and a multi-cloud environment. A single-cloud environment can be achieved with a single cloud provider to the server. The organization can decide only one or all applications and services to migrate or not. This environment uses public or private clouds whichever offer better serves the current or future needs.</p>
<p>As workload grows,the organization can move to the cloud because there is an option to expand virtualized servers beyond the limits of a single cloud server. Often, many organization uses this single cloud to employ the cloud for a single application or service.</p>
<p>With a multi-cloud environment, organizations use different cloud services from multiple providers. It is used for different tasks to achieve the best result or for reduced vendor lock-in. It reflects the increasing acknowledgment of clouds that are not created equally.</p>
<p>Also, with multiple clouds, organization get minimized dependence on one provider which reduces the cost and increase flexibility. The service cloud offers are:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Infrastructure-as-a-Service or IaaS</li>
<li>Platform-as-a-Service or PaaS</li>
<li>Software-as-a-Service or SaaS</li>
</ul>
<p>The services also include Storage, Information Process, Database, Integration, Application, Management, Security, and Testing-as-a-service.</p>
<h4><strong>3) Migrate Applications and Data</strong></h4>
<p>After proper planning, the process of migration should be done quickly and smoothly. It depends on the size of applications and databases. <strong>Top Cloud consulting companies</strong> use different methods to copy everything over. If there is less to migrate, then you need to copy the data over the internet connection. For long transfer times, the charges are more. They compress the data before sending or ship the physical drives to the services to reduce the cost of bandwidth.</p>
<p>During the migration process, security is a priority. Even temporary storage of data will be secure at the end destination. The cloud services allow access to different cloud migration tools. It can be used to help with migration.</p>
<p>When migrating to the cloud is finished, there will be other things to consider. Resource optimization is another important step. The cloud gets optimized and allocates resources statically. Then you will not take advantage of the strength of the cloud. When you move to the cloud, make sure the <strong>cloud migration services</strong> distribute resources to your application.</p>

<div dir="ltr">
<p>This blog will help you to install and understand docker on centos and mentioned steps will be helpful for your centos to update kernel version.</p>
<p>Below are the steps to install docker container and start working on it. As I have installed docker on Centos Server, below are the steps to install on it.</p>
<p>System Requirement:<br />
1) Kernel must be 3.10 or more then that.<br />
2) device-mapper-libs must be installed on it.</p>
<p><b><u>Steps are as below:</u></b><br />
<b><u><br />
</u></b><b><u>Step1:</u> Install 3.0 or later version of kernel.</b><br />
rpm &#8211;import https://www.elrepo.org/RPM-GPG-KEY-elrepo.org<br />
rpm -Uvh http://www.elrepo.org/elrepo-release-6-6.el6.elrepo.noarch.rpm<br />
yum -y &#8211;enablerepo=elrepo-kernel install kernel-lt<br />
yum -y install device-mapper-libs<br />
vim /etc/grub.conf and chnage default kernel to 0<br />
reboot<br />
uname -a</p>
<p><b><u>Step2:</u> Installation of Docker packge repository</b><br />
sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/docker.repo &lt;&lt;-&#8216;EOF&#8217;<br />
[dockerrepo]<br />
name=Docker Repository<br />
baseurl=https://yum.dockerproject.org/repo/main/centos/$releasever/<br />
enabled=1<br />
gpgcheck=1<br />
gpgkey=https://yum.dockerproject.org/gpg<br />
EOF</p>
<p><b><u>Step3:</u> Installation and Start docker service.</b><br />
yum install docker-engine<br />
service docker restart<br />
<u><br />
you can check logs by executing below command</u></p>
<p>tail -f /var/log/docker</p>
<p>Now Press CTRL+C</p>
<p><b><u>Step4:</u> Start your hello-word container.</b><br />
docker run hello-world<br />
docker ps -a<br />
You will see there will be 1 container running on your server with named hello-world</p>
<p><b><u><br />
</u></b><b><u>Nginx Docker setup: </u></b></p>
<p>docker pull nginx<br />
docker run &#8211;name docker-nginx -p 80:80 nginx<br />
mkdir -p ~/docker-nginx/html<br />
cd ~/docker-nginx/html<br />
vim index.html</p>
<p>docker ps -a<br />
docker stop docker-nginx<br />
docker ps -a<br />
docker rm docker-nginx<br />
docker run &#8211;name docker-nginx -p 80:80 -d -v ~/docker-nginx/html:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx</p>

<div dir="ltr">If you want to attach and check inside docker configuration and status<br />
<u>Login to docker on bash shell:</u><br />
docker exec -i -t 2f9f1cacb645 /bin/bash</p>
<p>Now you can check nginx service is running on it.</p>
